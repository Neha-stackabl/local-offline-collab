# Local Offline Collab Research Plan

## Goals
- Better understand the challenges developers have in building tools for offline/local-first/async needs
- Better understand the end-user needs for offline/local-first/async enabled tools
- Better understand how IPFS (and the related suite of protocols) can best support developers and end-users in the offline/local-first/async space

## Resources
- [Collection of videos, reading materials, and projects](https://github.com/ipfs/local-offline-collab/blob/master/Resources.md)

## Agenda

### Collect Use Cases
- Interview existing partners building tools for different offline/local-first/async use cases
- Define offline/local-first/async use cases we think IPFS might help with
- Document and augment existing knowledge about end-user needs for offline/local-first collaboration
- Collect and document existing knowledge about needs, best practices, and challenges around using IPFS for local/offline tools
- Connect with external offline/local/async communities

### Define Pain Points
- Create "state of the union" on IPFS support for top offline/local-first/async use cases
- Prioritize list of functionality needed to meet common offline/local-first/async needs
- Track current pain points in IPFS for offline/local-first/async tool development and propose solutions
- Track opportunities for IPFS to create additional value for offline/local-first/async developers and end users

### Boot WG Efforts
- Init WG with repo, charter, and core members
- Create regular forum for Locol WG to sync and define next steps
- Create research plan and start collab/partner/end-user outreach
- Form scrappy prototype community for testing pain points and demonstrating best practices

## Timeline
- 2018 Q4: Boot the WG
- 2019 Q1: Init research and community
- 2019 Q2: Use cases and pain points
- 2019 Q3: Scale the WG
